# NIFS example scripts

The enclosed scripts are provided as examples for reducing data from the NIFS instrument on Gemini. They are written by Morten Stostad for the data reduction in Stostad et al. (2015).

These scripts have been tested on K-band data from the following Gemini Programs: GN-2012A-Q-41, GN-2014A-Q-71. They can be downloaded from the Gemini Archives.

Questions about the scripts may be directed to the issues tracking on this repository, but responses may be limited. The goal of this repository is meant as an example, and is in no way comprehensive in terms of reducing NIFS data.
